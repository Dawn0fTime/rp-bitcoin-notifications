# Real Python Bitcoin Notifications Project

Based on the 
[Python Project for Beginners: Bitcoin Price Notifications](https://realpython.com/python-bitcoin-ifttt/) 
tutorial by Rok Novosel for Real Python. Some changes have been made to reflect 
the changes to the CoinMarketCap API.

## Setup
You will need to generate your own API key from 
[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) and IFTTT webhooks key from
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com).

You will also need to install the requests package in your virtual environment:
```bash
pip3 install requests
```

See the tutorial at [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-bitcoin-ifttt/)
for more details.
